Basic Python Syntax and Concepts

Variables and Data Types

Integers, floats, strings, booleans

Type casting

Operators

Arithmetic (+, -, *, /)

Comparison (==, !=, <, >, etc.)

Logical (and, or, not)

Assignment (=, +=, etc.)

Control Flow

if, elif, else statements

Boolean logic and nesting

Loops

for loops

while loops

break and continue

Functions

Defining functions (def)

Return values

Parameters and arguments

Scope (local vs. global)

Data Structures

Lists: indexing, slicing, appending, looping

Tuples: immutability, unpacking

Dictionaries: keys and values, .get(), .items()

Sets: uniqueness, basic operations

String Manipulation

Concatenation

String methods (.lower(), .split(), etc.)

f-strings and formatting

Input/Output

input() function

print() formatting

Reading from and writing to files

Error Handling

try/except

Handling exceptions gracefully

List Comprehensions

A compact way to create lists

PLC Data Parsing

You split the raw string into entries, then into fields.

This is exactly how protocols like OPC-UA or custom PLC strings are parsed.

Complexity = O(n) (efficient).

Later, if you parse L5X (which is XML), you’ll probably switch to an XML parser, but the idea is the same.

IP Address Validation

You first check the structure (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx).

Then you check octet ranges (0–255).

That’s the correct way to validate!

Industrial systems (PLC networks) often reject invalid IPs silently, so this check is gold.

Extracting Numbers

Your regex \d+\.?\d* finds both integers and decimals.

Converting to floats lets you compute statistics.

This is great for sanity checks on sensor values before passing them to ML models.

Tag Cleaning

Removing whitespace, special chars, converting to uppercase is essential.

Real PLC tag names often contain vendor-specific weirdness (pump#02@status).

Normalization ensures consistency (good for both databases and ML pipelines).

Sensor Reading Validation

Your regex enforces strict structure:

SENSOR_ID : VALUE : UNIT : TIMESTAMP


Example: TEMP_001:23.5:C:2024-03-15T14:30:00

That’s basically schema validation — which is what industrial protocols like MQTT or OPC-UA do behind the scenes.

⚙️ How this scales to PLC/L5X projects

The L5X file is XML (from Rockwell/Allen-Bradley Logix controllers).

Instead of splitting strings manually, you’ll parse it with Python’s xml.etree.ElementTree or lxml.

Each <Tag> element has attributes (Name, DataType, etc.), which you can clean/validate the same way you did here.

Example workflow:

Extract <Tag> from L5X → raw tag name

Clean the tag (re.sub) → normalized name

Validate values (your regex logic)

Store in structured format (e.g., JSON or DataFrame)

Key takeaway

What you’ve coded is not just an exercise — it’s a real-world mini data pipeline.

The same techniques (split, regex, normalization, validation) are exactly what you’ll apply to parse L5X tags and prepare PLC data for ML.

Next logical step: move from string parsing → structured parsing of XML (L5X).
