# Hi, I'm Kyaw ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an ever-learning student who enjoys building small, practical things.
This space is where I keep notes, experiments, and projects as I learn.

## What Iâ€™m learning right now
- Python for automation and testing
- Docker & FastAPI basics for simple APIs
- Computer vision foundations (U-Net, data prep)
- OT/IIoT and PLC/OPC UA fundamentals

## Projects (in progress)
- **Leviathan (notes & tooling)** â€” simple scripts and docs to understand PLC/SCADA faults
- **Dog & Cat Seg** â€” a tiny FastAPI service that serves a trained segmentation model
- **OPC UA Monitors** â€” experiments for reading tags and basic health checks

*Most repos are WIP. I try to write down what worked, what didnâ€™t, and why.*

## How I work
- Python, VS Code
- Git/GitHub for versioning
- Issues/README first, small commits, lots of notes

## Around the web
