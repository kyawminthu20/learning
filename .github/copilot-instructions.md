# Copilot Instructions

This is Kyaw's personal learning repository focusing on Python automation, Industrial IoT (IIoT), computer vision, and API development.

## Repository Context

This is a learning-focused workspace where projects are work-in-progress experiments and educational implementations. The repository serves as a collection of notes, small tools, and practical experiments rather than production software.

## Learning Focus Areas

- **Python automation and testing** - Scripts and tools for industrial automation
- **Docker & FastAPI** - Simple API development and containerization
- **Computer vision** - U-Net implementations and data preparation workflows  
- **OT/IIoT fundamentals** - PLC/OPC UA integration and monitoring tools

## Project Patterns

When working on projects in this repository:

1. **Documentation-first approach** - Always start with README files and issue descriptions before coding
2. **Small, incremental commits** - Commit frequently with descriptive messages explaining what worked and what didn't
3. **Learning notes included** - Document failures, discoveries, and reasoning in comments and markdown files
4. **Practical focus** - Prioritize working implementations over theoretical completeness

## Key Project Types

- **PLC Python Integrations** - Focus on simple scripts for PLC/SCADA fault understanding
- **Computer Vision APIs** - FastAPI services serving trained models (like dog/cat segmentation)
- **OPC UA Monitoring** - Basic tag reading and health check experiments

## Development Environment

- Primary language: Python
- Editor: VS Code
- Version control: Git/GitHub with issues-first workflow
- Containerization: Docker for API services

## Code Style Preferences

- Favor readability and educational value over optimization
- Include inline comments explaining industrial/domain-specific concepts
- Use descriptive variable names that reflect real-world industrial terminology
- Document both successful implementations and failed attempts for learning purposes

## When Contributing Code

- Assume this is for learning and experimentation, not production use
- Focus on clear, educational implementations
- Include relevant documentation about industrial protocols and standards
- Suggest improvements but explain the reasoning behind technical decisions
